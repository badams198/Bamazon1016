# Node.js & MySQL Assignment | "bamazon"

I'm working on creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

Bonus tasks to complete include programming my app to track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Important Notes
- You will need to run MySQL for this program or another databse application (possible adjustments needed to .sql file if using something besides MySQL).
- This is a command line application. I run this program directly from my preferred code editor (VS Code), so that's where you'll be starting and running this application after initializing your sample database.

## Instructions
1. After cloning this repo to your machine, open MySQL Workbench (or your preferred SQL Client) and initialize your database with the 'bamazonDB.sql' file.
2. Go to your terminal or preferred code editor and type `npm install` while inside the directory where you've saved this application's files.
3. Type `node bamazonCustomer.js` and press `enter` to begin running the program.
4. One of the packages you've installed with `npm install` in step two (Inquirer) will take you through the application step by step to simulate the buying process.
5. That's it!

## Closing Comments
- You're free to fork this or suggest edits as you'd see fit. This application is under MIT license and was a fun start to using Node.js in conjunction with MySQL. Drop me a line at `petewanca@gmail.com`.
